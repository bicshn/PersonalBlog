          Every blog starts somewhere. This is mine starting.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been meaning to write more for a long time. Not for any particular audience —
          mostly just to think out loud. Writing forces clarity in a way that keeping thoughts
          in your head never quite does.
        </p>

        <h2>What this will be</h2>

        <p>
          No specific theme. I write about whatever's holding my attention at the moment —
          things I'm learning, places I've been, ideas I keep returning to. Mixed topics,
          varied length, no schedule I'll pretend to keep.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          The best time to start was years ago. The second best time is now.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          If something here is useful or interesting to you, that's a bonus. But mostly this
          is a place for me to put things down and see how they look when they're out in the open.
        </p>

        <h2>How it's built</h2>

        <p>
          Plain HTML and CSS. No frameworks, no build step, no JavaScript unless I need it.
          Fast to load, easy to maintain, and I actually understand every line of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          More soon.
